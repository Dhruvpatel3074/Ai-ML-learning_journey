This folder contains my learning from **Python Fundamentals (Part 1)** as part of the **Apna College AI & ML course**.

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Python basics  
- Variables and data types  
- Comments and keywords  
- Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators  
- Type casting

## 🎯 Goal
To build a strong foundation in Python programming before moving into data science and machine learning concepts.

## 🧠 Learning Approach
- Practicing concepts through small programs  
- Writing clean and readable code  
- Understanding logic rather than memorizing  

📌 This repository will be updated as I progress further in my AI & ML journey.
